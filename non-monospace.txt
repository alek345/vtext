Eyhhh it almost works!!!

Althogh it's quite unusable

But nontheless atleast it doesn't crash

To get this working I have to render each glyph one by one
this would probably be slow but maybe a good idea
since it would to syntax highlighting a lot easier.
I could also have seperate text color for text under
the caret.
